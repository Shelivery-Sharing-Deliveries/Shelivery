## Key Milestones Achieved

### ‚úÖ Milestone 1: Project Governance Established
**Date**: January 25, 2025
**Deliverables**:
- Coding standards and development guidelines
- Token usage optimization strategy
- MCP server integration patterns
- Complete project documentation structure

### üéØ Next Milestone: Project Infrastructure Ready
**Target Date**: January 26, 2025
**Deliverables**:
- Next.js project with TypeScript configuration
- Basic directory structure following documentation
- PWA configuration files
- Development environment ready for coding

## Current Sprint Focus

### Active Development Tasks (Next 24 Hours)
1. **Complete Directory Structure**: Create all folders per documentation
2. **Initialize Next.js Project**: Set up with TypeScript and App Router
3. **Configure Package Dependencies**: Install Tailwind, Shadcn/ui, Supabase client
4. **Set up PWA Foundation**: Basic manifest and service worker configuration

### Immediate Blockers
- **Figma Access**: Need design file URLs for asset extraction
- **Supabase Project**: Need to create project via Supabase MCP

### Dependencies for Next Phase
- Slack clone repository analysis requires Git MCP access
- Design implementation requires Figma file access
- Database setup requires Supabase project configuration

## Quality Metrics

### Code Quality Standards
- **TypeScript Coverage**: Target 100% (strict mode)
- **Test Coverage**: Target 80% for critical business logic
- **Lint Issues**: Zero tolerance policy
- **Performance Budget**: <3s First Contentful Paint

### Documentation Completeness
- [‚úÖ] Project architecture documented
- [‚úÖ] User flows documented  
- [‚úÖ] Technical patterns documented
- [‚úÖ] Development guidelines established
- [‚è≥] API documentation (pending development)
- [‚è≥] Component documentation (pending development)

## Risk Assessment

### Current Risks
**Low Risk**:
- Next.js setup and basic configuration
- TypeScript and development tooling
- Basic PWA configuration

**Medium Risk**:
- Slack clone pattern adaptation complexity
- Real-time performance optimization
- App Router conversion challenges

**High Risk**:
- User adoption uncertainty (mitigated by controlled testing)
- Complex database trigger logic (mitigated by thorough testing)
- Real-time scale performance (mitigated by proven Supabase patterns)

## Resource Allocation

### MCP Server Usage Plan
- **Immediate**: Git MCP for Slack clone analysis
- **Phase 2**: Figma MCP for design asset extraction
- **Phase 3**: Supabase MCP for database setup
- **Testing**: Puppeteer MCP for E2E validation

### Time Allocation by Phase
- **Foundation (Days 1-2)**: 15% of total effort
- **Backend Setup (Days 3-7)**: 25% of total effort  
- **Core Features (Days 8-18)**: 40% of total effort
- **Testing & Deployment (Days 19-30)**: 20% of total effort
