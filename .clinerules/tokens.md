# Token Usage Guidelines for Shelivery MVP

## Efficient Token Management

### 1. Break Down Large Tasks
- Split complex implementations into smaller, focused steps
- Request "split into parts" for tasks that seem overwhelming
- Work on one component or feature at a time
- Complete each step before moving to the next

### 2. Context Reuse Strategies
- Reference existing code patterns instead of rewriting explanations
- Use "based on the previous implementation" to maintain context
- Build incrementally on established patterns
- Avoid repeating the same explanations in each interaction

### 3. Focused Problem Solving
- Address one specific issue per interaction when possible
- Be explicit about what you're trying to accomplish
- Provide clear acceptance criteria for each task
- Ask for specific help rather than general guidance

### 4. Code Review Efficiency
- Request focused reviews on specific sections when needed
- Use "check this implementation" for targeted feedback
- Avoid requesting full file reviews unless necessary
- Point out specific concerns or questions

### 5. Progressive Development
- Build features incrementally
- Test each component before integrating
- Use "add this feature to the existing component" approach
- Maintain working state at each step

### 6. Reference Documentation
- Link to existing implementations when possible
- Use "following the pattern from [component]" references
- Avoid re-explaining established patterns
- Build on documented decisions and conventions

## MCP Server Optimization

### 1. Supabase MCP Usage
- Batch related database operations when possible
- Use specific queries rather than broad explorations
- Test database functions in isolation before integration
- Leverage existing schema knowledge to avoid redundant queries

### 2. Git MCP Usage
- Reference specific files from Slack clone repository
- Extract focused patterns rather than entire implementations
- Use targeted searches for specific functionality
- Document adaptations for App Router conversion

### 3. Figma MCP Usage
- Extract assets in batches when possible
- Target specific components rather than entire files
- Use design token extraction efficiently
- Cache design specifications for reuse

## Communication Patterns

### 1. Clear Intent
- State the specific goal of each interaction
- Specify what type of help is needed
- Provide context about current implementation state
- Be explicit about dependencies and requirements

### 2. Iterative Feedback
- Request feedback on specific aspects
- Ask for validation of approach before full implementation
- Use "does this approach seem correct?" for complex logic
- Confirm understanding before proceeding

### 3. Error Resolution
- Provide specific error messages and context
- Include relevant code snippets for debugging
- Specify what was attempted and what failed
- Ask for targeted solutions rather than general troubleshooting
